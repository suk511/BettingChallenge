# Fixing GitHub Pages 404 Error for BettingChallenge

This guide specifically addresses the 404 error you're experiencing with your GitHub Pages deployment.

## What we've fixed

1. We've created a proper 404.html file in the public folder that handles client-side routing redirects
2. We've added the redirect script to index.html to handle URL processing
3. We've updated the App.tsx to use the correct base path for GitHub Pages
4. We've added build and deploy scripts to package.json
5. We've created an .env.production file with the correct base path

## How to deploy your app

1. Make sure all your local changes are committed to your repository
2. Run the deployment script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your application for production
- Deploy the build to a gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository

## GitHub repository settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/suk511/BettingChallenge)
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
3. Under "Source", make sure:
   - Deploy from a branch is selected
   - The branch is set to "gh-pages"
   - The folder is set to "/ (root)"
4. Click Save

Your site should now be published to https://suk511.github.io/BettingChallenge/

## Testing the deployment

When visiting your site at https://suk511.github.io/BettingChallenge/, you should be redirected to the login page. After logging in, you should be able to access all features of your application.

### Admin access

The admin panel will be accessible at https://suk511.github.io/BettingChallenge/adminpanel

Use the following credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: password123

## Important notes about the backend

Since GitHub Pages only hosts static files, your backend won't be available when users access your site from GitHub Pages. You have two options:

1. **For demonstration purposes only**: Change your app to use mock data instead of real API calls
2. **For production usage**: Deploy your backend to a server (like Heroku, Render, or Railway) and update your frontend API requests to point to that server

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see 404 errors:

1. Make sure your GitHub Pages is properly configured to use the gh-pages branch
2. Verify all the files were properly deployed by browsing the gh-pages branch
3. Double-check that 404.html is in the root of your deployed site
4. Check that your browser console doesn't show any errors related to loading resources
